# Netflix-clone

### ABOUT

Netflix-clone is a completely self-designed and made react project inspired by the popular netflix website, created for educational purposes only.

Using modern tools offered by the React language and the publicly available OMDb API, I wanted to create a website design as close to the Netflix as possible.

### Features

The project contains many crucial features that I learned while learning React: hooks, custome hook, context API, Carousel compnent, CSS modules, fetch API in purpose of creating my first self-made react portfolio site.
